# README Formatting Style

## Headers

- Use `#` for the document title only (e.g., `# README '/folder/name'` or project title)
- Use `##` for main sections (e.g., `## Table of Contents`, `## Activities`)
- Use `###` for subsections when needed
- Limit to two heading levels for clarity
- Keep headings concise and descriptive
- Section headers may include emojis (see below)

## Emojis

Use emojis to add visual structure and meaning:

- **Section headers**: Add an emoji prefix when it aids scanning (e.g., `## 🚀 Deployment`, `## 📚 Readings`)
- **Important notes**: Use 🚨 for critical information, ⚠️ for warnings
- **Status/actions**: Use ✅ for completed items, 💡 for tips, 🔧 for setup/technical sections
- **Navigation**: Use 🏠 for "Back to Top" and similar links
- Do not overuse; prefer consistency with a small set of emojis per document
- Common set: 🚨 ⚠️ ✅ 💡 🔧 📚 🎯 📋 🏠

## Tone

- **Concise**: Get to the point; avoid filler
- **Humble**: Assume limited prior knowledge; explain clearly without condescending
- **Direct**: State facts plainly; avoid hedging or padding
- **Avoid**:
  - "it is obvious," "clearly," "obviously," "as you can see"
  - "it is critical," "it goes without saying"
- **Prefer**: "This step configures X" over "It is critical that you configure X"
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms and file names; *italics* for subtle emphasis

## Section Order

Follow this recommended order:

1. **Header** — Banner image (if used), title, brief description in blockquote
2. **Quick links / navigation** — Optional top-level links
3. **Table of Contents** — Anchor links to sections (helps readers understand order)
4. **Main content sections** — Core content in logical order (e.g., Activities, Usage, Setup)
5. **Readings / References** — Optional list of links or resources
6. **Footer** — Footer image (if used), "Back to Top" link

Keep READMEs focused on navigation and overview; put detailed instructions in linked files.

## Code Blocks

- Use fenced code blocks with language tags for syntax highlighting (e.g., ` ```python `, ` ```r `)
- Include comments for non-obvious steps
- Keep examples short and runnable when possible
- **Reference the source file** above or below the block (e.g., "See [`script.py`](script.py) for the full implementation")
- Use inline backticks for: file names, function names, commands, short code snippets
- Prefer showing only the relevant portion; link to the full file for context

## References to Files

- **Always use relative hyperlinks** when referring to files
- **Activity/reading/document files**: Use human-readable titles as link text, e.g.  
  `[ACTIVITY: Run Example](ACTIVITY_example.md)` instead of `[`ACTIVITY_example.md`](ACTIVITY_example.md)`
- **Code/script files**: Use the filename in backticks as link text:  
  ``[`script.py`](script.py)`` or ``[`functions.R`](functions.R)``
- Place the link near the related code block or instruction
- Use a brief description after the link when useful (e.g., "— curl examples")

## Checklist

When writing or editing a README:

- [ ] Headers follow `#` title, `##` sections, `###` subsections
- [ ] Emojis used sparingly and consistently
- [ ] Tone is concise and humble; no filler phrases
- [ ] Section order matches: header → ToC → main content → readings → footer
- [ ] Code blocks have syntax highlighting and reference the source file
- [ ] All file references use relative links with appropriate link text
